This is a collection of various scripts or functions I've written that don't have any specific project tied to them. Either way, they're still helpful/useful in some capacity. If anything, maybe some example code for someone to check out. Everything in here is distributed with the GPL v2 license (read the COPYING file).

Enjoy!
